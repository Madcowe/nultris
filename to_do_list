- Create function to check and remove any complete rows each time a piece stops
Bug during game restart (lack of) animation gampelay seems to contiue hence mover can happen while not rendered
? Is NextGameAction necessary anymore now match remove would a boolean be better. 
? Does Legal_move being return from move piece actually needed, should remove if redundent
? Could mail_loop by organised better 
? Does occupied in Bloxel need to become an u8 rather than bool to match up with shapes in Piece?
? How do you stop user scrolling up terminal and seeing old frames
